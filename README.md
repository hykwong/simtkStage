The SimTK web-based project-hosting platform is designed to accelerate the development and dissemination of biosimulation software, models, and data. Its goal is to encourage and enable researchers to share their resources and knowledge. Started in 2005 with ten individuals from <a href="http://simbios.stanford.edu/">Simbios</a>, the NIH-funded center for physics-based simulations of biological structures, SimTK has transformed the biosimulation community. It has enables its 55,000 members to fulfill the data sharing responsibilities in their grants with no added cost, find collaborators, develop and build communities around simulation tools, and experiment with new forms of collaborations, like open-source model development. It is an ideal platform to enable the community to maximize its impact on health and biology. SimTK is forked from <a href="http://fusionforge.org/">FusionForge</a>.  SimTK is maintained through Grant R01 GM107340 from the National Institutes of Health (NIH).
